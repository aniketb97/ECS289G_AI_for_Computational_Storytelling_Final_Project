# Final Project files for ECS 289G - AI for Computational Storytelling

Interactive storytelling is an amalgamation of reading a story and playing a game. It is the art of narrating stories enhanced with technological interactive features to offer stories adapted to the constantly changing cultural ecosystem. We employ a unique methodology that involves feeding two custom-made stories to the systems. Then we define 21 metrics to judge and compare each system from the author's and player's perspectives. In terms of comparison of Parser-Based and Choice-Based Systems, we found that Choice-Based systems have more popularity in overall and most evaluation metrics. However, Parser-based systems have potential of being developed too and can be used by natural language, which make them easy to use.
